Problem statement: LLM‑assisted PRA COREP reporting assistant (prototype)
UK Banks subject to the PRA Rulebook must submit COREP regulatory returns that accurately reflect their capital, risk exposures and other prudential metrics, using complex reporting templates defined by EBA/PRA taxonomies and instructions. Preparing these returns is labour‑intensive and error‑prone because analysts must interpret dense, frequently updated rules and guidance, then translate them into the correct data fields and codes in COREP templates. 
The proposed prototype is an LLM‑assisted “regulatory reporting assistant” focused on one or two specific COREP templates (for example, own funds or capital requirements). Given a natural‑language question and a simple description of a reporting scenario, the assistant retrieves relevant PRA Rulebook sections and COREP instructions, then generates structured output aligned to a predefined schema for the selected template. The tool maps this output into a human‑readable reporting template (e.g. an extract of a COREP form), flags missing or inconsistent data using basic validation rules, and provides an audit log of which rule paragraphs were used to justify each populated field.
Success for the prototype is defined as:
	•	Demonstrating end‑to‑end behaviour from user question → retrieval of regulatory text → structured LLM output → populated template extract, within a constrained and well‑scoped subset of COREP
